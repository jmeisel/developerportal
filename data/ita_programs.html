Trade rules permit remedies when subsidies are "specific" (i.e., provided to a limited number of companies, such as all exporters) and have caused adverse trade effects. The SEO monitors and evaluates foreign subsidy practices that may adversely affect U.S. companies' export efforts. The SEO provides assistance to any U.S. company that has concerns with subsidization of foreign competitors. The SEO can evaluate the subsidy in relation to U.S. and multilateral trade rules to determine what remedial action might be taken to offset the subsidy to ensure that U.S. companies are competing in a fair international trading system.
